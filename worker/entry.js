/**
 * The deployed Worker entry point.
 *
 * `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare` emits a fetch-only `_worker.js` — an ESM
 * module whose default export has a `fetch` and nothing else. A Cloudflare
 * Cron Trigger needs a `scheduled()` export to call, so before this file the
 * platform could not run anything on a schedule, and the one recurring job it
 * had was curled from GitHub Actions instead. See issue #114.
 *
 * This wraps the adapter's output rather than replacing it: `fetch` is passed
 * through untouched, and `scheduled` is added. `wrangler.toml` points `main`
 * here, and wrangler bundles the import.
 *
 * The scheduled handler deliberately does no work of its own. It builds a
 * request and hands it to the app's own `fetch`, so every job runs inside
 * SvelteKit with the same bindings, the same `$lib` code and the same request
 * lifecycle as any other endpoint. The alternative — a second bundle of app
 * code reachable from plain JS — would mean two ways to run the same handler.
 *
 * This file is plain JavaScript on purpose. It is not part of the SvelteKit
 * build, so it is never type-checked or transformed; keeping it small and
 * dependency-free is what makes that safe.
