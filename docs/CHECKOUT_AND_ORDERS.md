# Checkout and Orders Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the checkout process, order management system, and
testing procedures for the Hermes eCommerce platform.

## Checkout Process

### Customer Flow

1. **Add Items to Cart**: Customers browse products and add items to their cart
2. **Navigate to Checkout**: Click "Checkout" from the cart page
3. **Complete Checkout Form**:
   - Step 1: Shipping Address
   - Step 2: Billing Address (can copy from shipping)
   - Step 3: Payment Method
4. **Submit Order**: Order is created and stored in the database
5. **Success Page**: Confirmation page with order details

### Implementation Details

- **Checkout Store**: `src/lib/stores/checkout.ts` manages checkout state
- **Checkout Page**: `src/routes/checkout/+page.svelte` provides the UI
- **API Endpoint**: `src/routes/api/orders/+server.ts` handles order creation
- **Database Layer**: `src/lib/server/db/orders.ts` manages order persistence

## Test Credit Card

For testing the checkout process, use the following test credit card:

```
Card Number: 5555 5555 5555 5555
Expiry Date: 01/23
CVV: 456
Cardholder Name: Any name
```

**Important Notes:**

- This test card is **only accepted in development/testing environments**
- The exact expiry date and CVV must be used as specified above
- Any other card number will go through basic validation (13-19 digits, valid
  expiry, 3-4 digit CVV)
- No actual payment processing occurs - orders are created immediately

### Payment Validation

The payment validation logic in `src/routes/api/orders/+server.ts`:

1. **Test Card Validation**:
   - Checks if card number is `5555555555555555` (without spaces)
   - Validates expiry month is `01` and year is `23`
   - Validates CVV is `456`
   - Returns validation error if any field is incorrect

2. **General Card Validation**:
   - Card number must be 13-19 digits
   - Must contain only digits (after removing spaces/dashes)
   - Expiry date must not be in the past
   - CVV must be 3 or 4 digits

3. **Security**:
   - Only last 4 digits of card number are stored
   - CVV is **never** stored in the database
   - Payment method details are stored as JSON in the orders table

## Orders Admin Interface

### Accessing Orders

Navigate to `/admin/orders` to view all orders for your site.

### Orders List View

   - Order ID
   - Current status
   - Order date
   - Last updated date

2. **Status Management**

### Updating Order Status

**Via API:**

```bash
PATCH /api/orders/[id]/status
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "shipped"
}
```

**Valid Statuses:**

- `pending`: Order received but not yet processed
- `processing`: Order is being prepared
- `shipped`: Order has been shipped to customer
- `delivered`: Order has been delivered
- `cancelled`: Order has been cancelled

## Database Schema

### Orders Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  site_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id TEXT,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  subtotal REAL NOT NULL,
  shipping_cost REAL NOT NULL,
  tax REAL NOT NULL,
  total REAL NOT NULL,
  shipping_address TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON
  billing_address TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON
  payment_method TEXT NOT NULL,   -- JSON
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (site_id) REFERENCES sites(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

### Order Items Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_items (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_id TEXT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  price REAL NOT NULL,
  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
  image TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```

## Multi-Tenant Isolation

All order operations are **scoped by site_id**:

- Orders can only be viewed by the site they belong to
- API endpoints automatically filter by `locals.siteId`
- Database queries always include `site_id` in WHERE clauses

## API Endpoints

### Create Order

```
POST /api/orders
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "prod-123",
      "name": "Product Name",
      "price": 29.99,
      "quantity": 2,
      "image": "/images/product.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "subtotal": 59.98,
  "shipping_cost": 9.99,
  "tax": 5.6,
  "total": 75.57,
  "shipping_address": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "555-1234",
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "state": "CA",
    "zipCode": "12345",
    "country": "United States"
  },
  "billing_address": {
    /* same structure as shipping_address */
  },
  "payment_method": {
    "type": "credit-card",
    "cardNumber": "5555 5555 5555 5555",
    "cardHolderName": "John Doe",
    "expiryMonth": "01",
    "expiryYear": "23",
    "cvv": "456"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "orderId": "order-abc123",
  "order": {
    "id": "order-abc123",
    "status": "pending",
    "total": 75.57,
    "created_at": 1234567890
  }
}
```

### Update Order Status

```
PATCH /api/orders/[id]/status
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "status": "shipped"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "order": {
    "id": "order-abc123",
    "status": "shipped",
    "updated_at": 1234567890
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run orders API tests
npm test -- src/routes/api/orders/+server.test.ts

# Run orders database tests
npm test -- src/lib/server/db/orders.test.ts
```

### Test Coverage

The following are tested:

- ✅ Order creation with test card
- ✅ Payment validation (correct test card details)
- ✅ Rejection of invalid CVV
- ✅ Rejection of expired cards
- ✅ Rejection of empty orders
- ✅ Database CRUD operations
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation

### Manual Testing

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Add products to cart** by browsing to the homepage

3. **Go to checkout** at `/checkout`

4. **Fill out the checkout form:**
   - Enter any shipping address
   - Optionally copy to billing address
   - Use the test credit card: `5555 5555 5555 5555`, `01/23`, `456`

5. **Submit the order** and verify success page

6. **View order in admin** at `/admin/orders`

7. **Test status updates** by clicking into an order and changing its status

## Security Considerations

- ✅ CVV is never stored
- ✅ Only last 4 digits of card are stored
- ✅ All orders are scoped by site_id
- ✅ Payment validation prevents basic input errors
- ✅ Test card only works in development

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the checkout and orders system:

1. **Real Payment Integration**: Integrate with Stripe, PayPal, or other payment
   processors
2. **Email Notifications**: Send order confirmation and status update emails
3. **Order Tracking**: Add tracking numbers and carrier information
4. **Refunds**: Add refund processing capabilities
5. **Order History**: Customer-facing order history page
6. **Inventory Management**: Automatic inventory deduction on order creation
7. **Order Search**: Search and filter orders by various criteria
8. **Export**: Export orders to CSV for accounting/reporting
9. **Shipping Labels**: Integration with shipping label providers
10. **Analytics**: Order analytics dashboard with charts and metrics
